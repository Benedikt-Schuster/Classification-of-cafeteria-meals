# Classification of cafeteria meals 

This project was conducted as part of the Digital Business and Platforms module at the University of Leipzig. The aim of the study was to analyze how artificial intelligence can be used to classify cafeteria meals. Automated meal recognition is intended to optimize the payment process in the university cafeteria.
The project included: 
- Business Case Analysis: Examining the current state of the Studentenwerk Leipzig cafeterias and identifying challenges in meal classification.
- Data Collection & Preprocessing: Capturing and preparing images of cafeteria meals, including dataset splitting, transformations, and augmentations.
- Model Development: Implementing transfer learning techniques, training different models, and evaluating performance using relevant metrics.
- Explainable AI (XAI): Integrating methods like LIME and Grad-CAM to enhance model interpretability.
- Model Deployment: Exploring deployment strategies for real-world application in self-checkout systems.
